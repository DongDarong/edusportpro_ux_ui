ADMIN SECTION - DETAILED DESCRIPTION (EDUSPORTPRO)

1. ADMIN SECTION PURPOSE
The Admin section is the system control center of EduSportPro. It is responsible for governance, setup, and operational oversight across all sports-management modules. Admin can configure users and roles, manage teams/players, schedule and monitor activities, oversee competition structure (tournament/division), and analyze outputs through reports.

Primary objective:
- Ensure data consistency and operational control across Coach and Player modules.
- Provide authoritative creation/update/deletion abilities where business ownership belongs to administration.

2. ADMIN ROLE CAPABILITY SCOPE
Admin capabilities are full-access in the frontend and mapped to full-access permission intent in SQL logic:
- Create / Read / Update / Delete (CRUD) for core entities.
- Publish data that downstream roles consume (Coach/Player).
- Trigger communication workflows (notifications).
- Maintain structure and compliance (roles, permissions, division/tournament hierarchy).

Admin boundary:
- Admin is the source of truth for organization-level data.
- Coach and Player modules consume or update only role-appropriate subsets.

3. ADMIN IA (INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE)
Admin menu is organized into:
- Operational Core:
  - Dashboard, Users, Teams, Players, Matches, Training, Attendance, Calendar
- Management/Control:
  - Performance, Inventory, Reports
- Account/Support:
  - Notifications, Profile
- Competition Structure:
  - Tournament, Division
- Admin sidebar implementation is centralized using:
  - `admin/admin-sidebar-component.html` (shared menu markup)
  - `admin/admin-sidebar-loader.js` (injects sidebar + applies active state)

This structure supports top-down operations:
1) Configure people and access ->
2) Configure teams and athlete data ->
3) Run schedules/events/matches ->
4) Capture outcomes and metrics ->
5) Review reports and adjust decisions.

5. ADMIN WORKFLOW CHAINS (END-TO-END)

Workflow A: Identity to Operations
1) Create user (users/user-create)
2) Assign role
3) Create team (teams/team-create)
4) Create players (players/create-player)
5) Assign players to teams (backend mapping)
6) Start training/calendar/match operations

Workflow B: Match Lifecycle
1) Create match (matches)
2) Run event (calendar + operational execution)
3) Enter result (match-results)
4) Update standings/statistics (backend logic)
5) Consume outcome in reports

Workflow C: Calendar Communication
1) Admin creates event in calendar
2) Select audience scope via Add Team
3) Save event
4) Notification distribution by scope
5) Coach/player receive role-scoped event visibility

6. ACCESS & PERMISSION MODEL (ADMIN VIEW)
Admin intent:
- Full module-level create/update/delete permissions.
- View permissions across all modules.
- Manage role-permission relationships.

Key policy outcomes:
- Admin can edit tournament/division.
- Coach/player are view-only for tournament/division.
- Admin can publish broad or targeted calendar events.

7. DATA MODEL RELATIONSHIP TO ADMIN MODULES
Admin pages map primarily to these tables/views (SQL design intent):
- users, roles, permissions, role_permissions
- teams, team_players, coaches, players
- trainings, attendance
- matches, match_results, match_events, player_match_statistics
- tournaments, divisions, tournament_divisions, groups, group_teams, standings
- calendar_events, calendar_event_teams, notifications, calendar_event_recipients
- vw_tournament_summary, vw_division_standings, vw_calendar_events

8. QUALITY AND GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITIES
Admin section must ensure:
- Referential integrity (no orphan assignments).
- Permission integrity (correct role boundaries).
- Communication correctness (event audience targeting).
- Auditability (timestamps/activity logs).
- Data consistency across modules sharing entities.

9. KNOWN IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS
- Current frontend is static-prototype oriented (mock interactions in several modules).
- UI logic for scope-based calendar notifications exists and should be enforced server-side.
- Backend procedure (`sp_create_calendar_event`) and mapping table (`calendar_event_teams`) are intended to operationalize admin targeting logic.
- Admin pages use a shared sidebar component to keep menu links consistent
  (including Tournament and Division).

10. RECOMMENDED BACKEND ENFORCEMENT FOR ADMIN MODULE
- Validate admin role on all write endpoints.
- Wrap multi-step writes in transactions (calendar event + recipients + notifications).
- Normalize team target input into structured arrays/IDs.
- Centralize permission checks via middleware/policy layer.
- Add integration tests for:
  - all-team notification fanout,
  - multi-team notification fanout,
  - coach/player visibility boundaries.

11. SUMMARY
The Admin section is the governing layer of EduSportPro: it initializes and controls actors, structures competition, schedules operations, records outcomes, and drives communication. It is both an operational cockpit and a compliance boundary that defines what downstream roles can see or change.
